## What is the research objective? 

The objectives of these surveys are to: 

 - monitor trends in the marine ecosystem of the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska
 - produce fishery-independent biomass and abundance estimates for commercially important fish and crab species 
 - collect biological and environmental data for use in ecosystem-based fishery management.
