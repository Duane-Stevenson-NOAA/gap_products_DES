  Index Computation Working Group: consolidation of index computation methods between the Bering Sea and AI-GOA regions.\n\n    -   Data Processes Working Group: consolidation, clean up, and reorganization of survey oracle schemata, tables, and other data for all surveys.\n\n-   December 2022: [GAP and SSMA discuss](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AURrvC1na6TL1Um3p7018svBLDOnih_7nxxyRU34M0k/edit) integration of the restratification of the GOA survey design into standard data products. \n\n    -   Stock assessors requested a \\\"dry run\\\" test to work with new mock restratified GOA survey data before implementation of the new survey design. \n\n    -   This prompted the postponement of the restratified GOA design to 2025. \n\n-   February 2023: Decision was made to include the mock restratified GOA data with the development of the new consolidated standard data products.. \n\n-   May 2023: Release of new, draft, standard data product tables, including restratified GOA data.\n    Stock assessment authors will have the opportunity to explore differences between datasets, test workflows, and provide comments and issues during summer 2023.\n\n-   September 2023: Release of provisional standard data product tables and historical tables containing 2023 survey data in the GAP_PRODUCTS schema.\n\n-   December 2023 - March 2024: Meeting between GAP and stock assessment groups in early December 2023 to update progress on the GAP_PRODUCTS testing phase.\n    **Deadline for Comments and Feedback on GAP_PRODUCTS data structures is March 8, 2024.**\n\nSeptember 2024: GAP will only release data products according to the new standard.\nCurrent, historical data product tables will be archived in a new schema called \\\"**GAP_ARCHIVE**\\\".\n\n## What is the research objective?\n\nThe objectives of these surveys are to:\n\n-   monitor trends in the marine ecosystem of the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska\n-   produce fishery-independent biomass and abundance estimates for commercially important fish and crab species\n-   collect biological and environmental data for use in ecosystem-based fishery management.\n\nLearn more about the [program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/science-data/groundfish-assessment-program-bottom-trawl-surveys)\n\n![Sorting and weighing fish on deck on the 2022 Bering Sea groundfish survey aboard the F/V Alaska Knight.
