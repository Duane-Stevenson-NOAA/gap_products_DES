AKFIN integrates this information into a single data management system using consistent methods and standardized formats. The Network then reports this information on its website, in various publications, and to researchers. The resulting data enables fishery managers, scientists, and associated agencies to supervise fisheries resources more effectively and efficiently. \n\nIf you are an AFSC employee with access to data through our internal database Oracle server, use this [guide](https://afsc-gap-products.github.io/gap_products/content/akfin-oracle-sql-r.html) to access our data.
