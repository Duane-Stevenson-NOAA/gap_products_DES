They are developed and managed by an association or other body (the ‘Code Owner’) which is representative of a sector (or category of data controllers or processors), with the expert and sectoral knowledge of how to enhance data protection in their area.\n\n### [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) from the [nmfs-opensci
