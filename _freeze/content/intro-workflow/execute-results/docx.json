The suitability of these data products for analysis varies and there is ambiguity about which data products can be used for which purpose. This ambiguity can create challenges in communicating about data products and potentially lead to misunderstanding and misuse of data. One approach to communicating about the level of processing applied to data products and their suitability for analysis is to describe data products using a Data Processing Level system. Data Processing Level systems are widely used in earth system sciences to characterize the extent of processing that has been applied to data products. For example, the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Satellite Program uses a Data Processing Level system to describe data on a scale of 0-4, where Level 0 is raw data and Level 4 is model output or results from analysis. Example of how [NASA remote sensing data products](https://ladsweb.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/search/) are shared through a public data portal with levels of data processing and documentation. \n\nFor more information, see [Sean Rohan's October 2022 SCRUGS presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rWSZpeghWJqzWMIa5oBc4BCoy-zy1Yue86RoTw58u6M/edit?usp=sharing) on the topic. \n\n - **Level 0**: Raw and unprocessed data. Ex: Data on the G drive, some tables in RACE_DATA\n - **Level 1A**: Data products with QA/QC applied that may or may not be expanded to analysis units, but either not georeferenced or does not include full metadata. Ex: Some tables in RACE_DATA and RACEBASE\n - **Level 2**: Analysis-ready data products that are derived for a standardized extent and account for zeros and missing/bad data. Ex: CPUE tables, some data products in public-facing archives and repositories\n - **Level 3**: Data products that are synthesized across a standardized extent, often inputs in a higher-level analytical product. Ex: Abundance indices, some data products in public-facing archives and repositories\n - **Level 4**: Analytically generated data products that are derived from lower-level data, often to inform management. Ex: Biological reference points from stock assessments, Essential Fish Habitat layers, indicators in Ecosystem Status Reports and Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles",
