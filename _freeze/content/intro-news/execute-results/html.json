While trying to update the records in the GAP_PRODUCTS table, the connection was terminated, partially uploading records in the agecomp tables and outputting NA to the N_HAUL and N_LENGTH fields in the biomass tables. At this point, the GAP_PRODUCTS tables are incomplete. The AKFIN and FOSS tables were NOT updated in this run.\n\n -- [GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2024-05-04) using gapindex v2.2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/main/content/intro-news/2024-05-04.txt): A development branch version of gapindex called [using_datatable](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/tree/using_datatable) uses the data.table package for many dataframe manipulations, which greatly decreased the computation time of many of the functions. There were no major changes in the calculations in this version of the gapindex package and thus the major changes listed below are not related to the gapindex package. The only major change from this run was the addition of GOA 2023 Pacific Ocean perch read otolith data. \n\n -- [GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2024-04-09) using gapindex v2.2.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/main/content/intro-news/2024-04-09.txt): A development branch version of gapindex called [using_datatable](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/tree/using_datatable) uses the data.table package for many dataframe manipulations, which greatly decreased the computation time of many of the functions.

As a result, there will be some SPECIES_CODE values that are supported due to slight differences between the two tables. Discussion in this [github issue #54](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gapindex/issues/54). As a result there are new cpue records for SPECIES_CODE values 22290 and 22292 and removed cpue records for SPECIES_CODE values 21345, 22200 and 69326. \n\n -- [GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2024-01-09) using gapindex v2.1.3](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/main/content/intro-news/2024-01-09.txt): A new version of gapindex ([v2.1.3](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gapindex/releases/tag/v2.1.3)) was used to produced these data. Data for SPECIES_CODE 68590 (Chionoecetes hybrids) are now removed, per this issue (https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/issues/3). New read otolith data were incorporated into the age compositions. GOA depth subareas are now included in the size comps, and there were some modifications with EBS skate length data that are now incorporated into the length compositions. \n\n -- [GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2023-11-17) using gapindex v2.1.2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/main/content/intro-news/2023-11-17.txt): A new version of gapindex ([v2.1.2](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gapindex/releases/tag/v2.1.2)) was used to produced these data. There was a slight change to how subarea biomass totals are calculated that was not fully addressed in v2.1.1. The modified biomass records reflect this change.\n\n -- [GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2023-11-14) using gapindex v2.1.1](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/main/content/intro-news/2023-11-14_v2-1-1.txt): A new version of gapindex (v2.1.1) was used to produced these data. There was a slight change to how subarea biomass totals are calculated. The modified biomass records reflect this change. New 2022 otolith data were available since the last iteration of the GAP_PRODUCTS for Aleutian Island Pacific ocean perch and northern rockifsh and Eastern Bering Sea northern rock sole. Zero-filled CPUE records for four GOA species codes (SPECIES_CODE: 21210, 30010, 30360, 77102, 98101) were added due to how the 1990 data were integrated in the last production run of GAP_PRODUCTS. Two Arctic cod (SPECIES_CODE: 21725) and one plain sculpin (SPECIES_CODE: 21371) count records were modified in the NBS data, which changes the numerical CPUE estimates for those hauls which changes the estimated population abundance and size composition for those species.\n\n -- [Groundfish Assessment Program Survey Data Serving and Data Improvements](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/main/content/intro-news/2023-06-20_datachangesbreif): Initial data changes brief distributed to SSMA and other partners by Ned Laman, Zack Oyafuso, and Emily Markowitz\n\n -- [Run 2023-06-01 gapindex v2.1.0](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/main/content/intro-news/2023-06-01_v2-1-0.txt): Initial compiling and planning notes\n\n",
