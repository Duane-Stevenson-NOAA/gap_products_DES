# Metadata

## Data Description

The Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE)
Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) of the Alaska Fisheries Science
Center (AFSC) conducts fisheries-independent bottom trawl surveys to
monitor the condition of the demersal fish and crab stocks of Alaska.
These data are developed to describe the temporal distribution and
abundance of commercially and ecologically important groundfish species,
examine the changes in the species composition of the fauna over time
and space, and describe the physical environment of the groundfish
habitat.

There are no legal restrictions on access to the data. They reside in
the public domain and can be freely distributed. Users must read and
fully comprehend the metadata prior to use. Data should not be used
beyond the limits of the source scale. Acknowledgement of NOAA, as the
source from which these data were obtained, in any publications and/or
other representations of these data, is suggested. These data are
compiled and approved annually after each summer survey season. The data
from previous years are unlikely to change substantially once published.
Some survey data are excluded, such as non-standard stations, surveys
completed in earlier years using different/non-standard gear, and
special tows and non-standard data collections.

The data calculated in this repo include:

1)  all (presence and absence; a.k.a. “zero-filled”) observations from
    surveys conducted on fishing vessels. These surveys monitor trends
    in distribution and abundance of groundfish, crab, and
    bottom-dwelling species in Alaska’s marine ecosystems. These data
    include estimates of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for most
    identified species at a standard set of stations.

2)  Stratum- and total-level biomass and abundance estimates. \[**More
    description coming soon**\]

3)  Stratum- and total-level length and age comp estimates. \[**More
    description coming soon**\]: using length and otoliths (fish ear
    bones to learn about age).
