*These data were last ran and pushed to the AFSC oracle on `r gsub("(\\D)0", "\\1", format(file.info(paste0(dir_out, "cpue_station.csv"))$mtime, "%B %d, %Y"))`*. This is not the date that these data were pulled into FOSS and the FOSS dataset may be behind. 

# Metadata

## Data Description

The Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts fisheries-independent bottom trawl surveys to monitor the condition of the demersal fish and crab stocks of Alaska. These data are developed to describe the temporal distribution and abundance of commercially and ecologically important groundfish species, examine the changes in the species composition of the fauna over time and space, and describe the physical environment of the groundfish habitat.

There are no legal restrictions on access to the data. They reside in the public domain and can be freely distributed. Users must read and fully comprehend the metadata prior to use. Data should not be used beyond the limits of the source scale. Acknowledgement of NOAA, as the source from which these data were obtained, in any publications and/or other representations of these data, is suggested. These data are compiled and approved annually after each summer survey season. The data from previous years are unlikely to change substantially once published. Some survey data are excluded, such as non-standard stations, surveys completed in earlier years using different/non-standard gear, and special tows and non-standard data collections.

The data calculated in this repo include: 

1) all (presence and absence; a.k.a. "zero-filled") observations from surveys conducted on fishing vessels. These surveys monitor trends in distribution and abundance of groundfish, crab, and bottom-dwelling species in Alaska’s marine ecosystems. These data include estimates of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for most identified species at a standard set of stations. 

2) Stratum- and total-level biomass and abundance estimates. [**More description coming soon**]

3) Stratum- and total-level length and age comp estimates. [**More description coming soon**]: using length and otoliths (fish ear bones to learn about age).

## Table short metadata

<!-- ### Station-level CPUE data (zero filled) -->

```{r metadata-table-0, echo = FALSE}
# a <- list.files(path = "./output/", pattern = "metadata_table")
# metadata_table <- ""
# for (i in 1:length(a)) {
#   metadata_table <- paste0(metadata_table, "
# 
# ", 
# readLines(paste0(dir_out, a[i])))
# }

# cat(metadata_table)
```

`r metadata_table `

```{r metadata-column, echo = FALSE}
metadata_column0 <- read.csv(file = paste0(dir_out, "metadata_column.csv"))
names(metadata_column0) <- c("Column name from data", "Descriptive Column Name", "Units", "Description")
knitr::kable(metadata_column0, row.names = FALSE) 
```

## Table-level metadata

metadata_column0 <- read.csv(file = paste0(dir_out, "metadata_column.csv")) %>% 
  dplyr::select(
    "Column name from data" = metadata_colname, 
    "Descriptive column Name" = metadata_colname_long, 
    "Units" = metadata_units, 
    "Oracle data type" = metadata_datatype,
