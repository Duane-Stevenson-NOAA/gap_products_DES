# Access data via Oracle (AFSC-only)

If you have access to the AFSC Oracle data base, you can pull the data directly from the Oracle schema these data are pulled from for FOSS. 

You will need to install the `RODBC` R package and have OFIS (IT) connect R to Oracle. Once connected, you can use the following code in R to connect to Oracle. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("RODBC")

channel<-odbcConnect(dsn = "AFSC",
                     uid = "USERS_USERNAME", # change
                     pwd = "USERS_PASSWORD", # change
                     believeNRows = FALSE)

odbcGetInfo(channel)
```

Then, you can pull and save (if you need) the table into your R environment. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# pull table from oracle into R environment
a <- RODBC::sqlQuery(channel, "SELECT * FROM FAP_PRODUCTS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED")
# Save table to local directory
write.csv(x = a, 
          file = "RACEBASE_FOSS-FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED.csv")
```

This is presence and absence data. This is a huge file and has all of the bells and whistles. For reference: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

str0 <- paste0(
  "RACEBASE_FOSS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED: ", "
  rows: ", nrow(cpue_station_0filled), "
  cols: ", ncol(cpue_station_0filled), "
  ", round(file.size(paste0(dir_out, "cpue_station_0filled.csv"))/1e+9, 3), " GB") 

cat(str0)

```

If you only want to pull a small subset of the data (especially since files like `RACEBASE_FOSS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED` are so big), you can use a variation of the following code. Here, we are pulling EBS Pacific cod from 2010 - 2021: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Pull data
a <- RODBC::sqlQuery(channel, "SELECT * FROM RACEBASE_FOSS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED 
WHERE SRVY = 'EBS' 
AND COMMON_NAME = 'Pacific cod' 
AND YEAR >= 2010 
AND YEAR < 2021")

# Save table to local directory
write.csv(x = a, 
          file = "RACEBASE_FOSS-FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED-ebs_pcod_2010-2020.csv")
```
