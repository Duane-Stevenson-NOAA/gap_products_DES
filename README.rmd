# Metadata

## Data Description

The Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts fisheries-independent bottom trawl surveys to monitor the condition of the demersal fish and crab stocks of Alaska. These data are developed to describe the temporal distribution and abundance of commercially and ecologically important groundfish species, examine the changes in the species composition of the fauna over time and space, and describe the physical environment of the groundfish habitat.

There are no legal restrictions on access to the data. They reside in the public domain and can be freely distributed. Users must read and fully comprehend the metadata prior to use. Data should not be used beyond the limits of the source scale. Acknowledgement of NOAA, as the source from which these data were obtained, in any publications and/or other representations of these data, is suggested. These data are compiled and approved annually after each summer survey season. The data from previous years are unlikely to change substantially once published. Some survey data are excluded, such as non-standard stations, surveys completed in earlier years using different/non-standard gear, and special tows and non-standard data collections.

The data calculated in this repo include: 

1) all (presence and absence; a.k.a. "zero-filled") observations from surveys conducted on fishing vessels. These surveys monitor trends in distribution and abundance of groundfish, crab, and bottom-dwelling species in Alaska’s marine ecosystems. These data include estimates of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for most identified species at a standard set of stations. 

2) Stratum- and total-level biomass and abundance estimates. [**More description coming soon**]

3) Stratum- and total-level length and age comp estimates. [**More description coming soon**]: using length and otoliths (fish ear bones to learn about age).

## Table short metadata

### Station-level CPUE data (zero filled)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
a <- list.files(path = "./output/", pattern = "table_metadata")
table_metadata <- ""
for (i in 1:length(a)) {
  table_metadata <- paste0(table_metadata, "

", 
readLines(paste0(dir_out, a[i])))
}

# cat(table_metadata)
```

`r table_metadata `

## Column-level metadata

```{r, echo = FALSE}
column_metadata0 <- read.csv(file = paste0(dir_out, "column_metadata.csv"))
names(column_metadata0) <- c("Column name from data", "Descriptive Column Name", "Units", "Description")
knitr::kable(column_metadata0, row.names = FALSE) 
```

# Access data via Oracle (AFSC-only)

If you have access to the AFSC Oracle data base, you can pull the data directly from the Oracle schema these data are pulled from for FOSS. 

You will need to install the `RODBC` R package and have OFIS (IT) connect R to Oracle. Once connected, you can use the following code in R to connect to Oracle. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library("RODBC")

channel<-odbcConnect(dsn = "AFSC",
                     uid = "USERS_USERNAME", # change
                     pwd = "USERS_PASSWORD", # change
                     believeNRows = FALSE)

odbcGetInfo(channel)
```

Then, you can pull and save (if you need) the table into your R environment. 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}

# pull table from oracle into R environment
a <- RODBC::sqlQuery(channel, "SELECT * FROM FAP_PRODUCTS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED")
# Save table to local directory
write.csv(x = a, 
          file = "RACEBASE_FOSS-FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED.csv")
```

This is presence and absence data. This is a huge file and has all of the bells and whistles. For reference: 

```{r, echo = FALSE}

str0 <- paste0(
  "RACEBASE_FOSS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED: ", "
  rows: ", nrow(cpue_station_0filled), "
  cols: ", ncol(cpue_station_0filled), "
  ", round(file.size(paste0(dir_out, "cpue_station_0filled.csv"))/1e+9, 3), " GB") 

cat(str0)

```

If you only want to pull a small subset of the data (especially since files like `RACEBASE_FOSS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED` are so big), you can use a variation of the following code. Here, we are pulling EBS Pacific cod from 2010 - 2021: 

```{r, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Pull data
a <- RODBC::sqlQuery(channel, "SELECT * FROM RACEBASE_FOSS.FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED 
WHERE SRVY = 'EBS' 
AND COMMON_NAME = 'Pacific cod' 
AND YEAR >= 2010 
AND YEAR < 2021")

# Save table to local directory
write.csv(x = a, 
          file = "RACEBASE_FOSS-FOSS_CPUE_ZEROFILLED-ebs_pcod_2010-2020.csv")
```
