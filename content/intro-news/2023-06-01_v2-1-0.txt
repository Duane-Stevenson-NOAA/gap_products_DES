### GOA 2025 Restratification -- Mock Data for Testing

The plan will be, once all are satisfied with the new GAP_PRODUCTS schema and tables, to sunset the historic product tables in 2024 and proceed with only GAP_PRODUCTS for the 2024 post-survey stock assessment season.

-   December 2023 - March 2024: Meeting between GAP and stock assessment groups in early December 2023 to update progress on the GAP_PRODUCTS testing phase.
    **Deadline for Comments and Feedback on GAP_PRODUCTS data structures is March 8, 2024.**

-   September 2024: GAP will only release data products according to the new standard.
Current, historical data product tables will be archived in a new schema called \"**GAP_ARCHIVE**\".



## Previous updates

-   September 2023: Provisional data product tables -- CPUE, BIOMASS, SIZECOMP, and AGECOMP -- as well as provisional support tables -- AREA, STRATUM_GROUPS, METADATA_COLUMN, SPECIES_YEAR, SURVEY_DESIGN -- are available in the GAP_PRODUCTS Oracle schema with updated 2023 GOA and EBS survey data.
    
    -   Additionally, the inclusion of mock data for the under the new 2025 GOA stratified random survey (labeled in the GAP_PRODUCTS tables as YEAR 2025) will provide stock authors with the opportunity to interact with data from the new survey design to be implemented in 2025.
   
    -   Provisional AKFIN and FOSS tables are also available in the GAP_PRODUCTS Oracle schema. These include: AKFIN_AGECOMP, AKFIN_AREA, AKFIN_BIOMASS, AKFIN_CATCH, AKFIN_CPUE, AKFIN_CRUISE, AKFIN_HAUL, AKFIN_LENGTH, AKFIN_METADATA_COLUMN, AKFIN_SIZECOMP, AKFIN_SPECIMEN, AKFIN_SURVEY_DESIGN, AKFIN_STRATUM_GROUPS, FOSS_CATCH, FOSS_CPUE_PRESONLY, FOSS_HAUL, and FOSS_TAXON_GROUP.


-   May 2023: Release of new, draft, standard data product tables, including restratified GOA data.
    Stock assessment authors will have the opportunity to explore differences between datasets, test workflows, and provide comments and issues during summer 2023.


-   February 2023: Decision was made to include the mock restratified GOA data with the development of the new consolidated standard data products.


-   December 2022: [GAP and SSMA discuss](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AURrvC1na6TL1Um3p7018svBLDOnih_7nxxyRU34M0k/edit) integration of the restratification of the GOA survey design into standard data products.

    -   Stock assessors requested a \"dry run\" test to work with new mock restratified GOA survey data before implementation of the new survey design.

    -   This prompted the postponement of the restratified GOA design to 2025.

-   October 2022: The data processes and index computation working group convened to address the development of standard survey data products (e.g., biomass/abundance, size composition, age composition, CPUE).

    -   Index Computation Working Group: consolidation of index computation methods between the Bering Sea and AI-GOA regions.

    -   Data Processes Working Group: consolidation, clean up, and reorganization of survey oracle schemata, tables, and other data for all surveys.
