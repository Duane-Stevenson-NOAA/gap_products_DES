GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2024-02-29) using gapindex v2.2.0
A new version of gapindex [2.2.0](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gapindex/releases/tag/v2.2.0) was used for this production run and now accesses taxonomic information from RACEBASE.SPECIES instead of GAP_PRODUCTS.TAXONOMIC_CLASSIFICATION. As a result, there will be some SPECIES_CODE values that are supported due to slight differences between the two tables. Discussion in this [github issue #54](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gapindex/issues/54). As a result there are new cpue records for SPECIES_CODE values 22290 and 22292 and removed cpue records for SPECIES_CODE values 21345, 22200 and 69326. 

- GOA: There are 19 records of unidentified snailfish (22200) that were vouchered to Careproctus sp. cf. melanurus (Orr et al.; 22290)

- NBS: There was one record of Hemilepidotus zapus (21345) that was vouchered and modified to Myoxocephalus scorpius (21368) and a record of unidentified Liparis sp. snailfishes (22201) that were vouchered as Liparis gibbus (22205) and Liparis marmoratus (22265).

-EBS: There was one record addition for Pagurus rathbuni (69095). 

- AREA_ID values for Aleutian Islands Southern Bering Sea INPFC x Depth subareas were renamed to eliminate the historical redundancy of 793 and 794 coding for both strata and INPFC x Depth subareas. Discussion in this [github issue #28](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/issues/28). These changes were made to the GAP_PRODUCTS.AREA and GAP_PRODUCTS.STRATUM_GROUPS table and affects the new/removed records summary for the AI region.

AREA_TYPE	      OLD AREA_ID	  NEW AREA_ID

INPFC BY DEPTH	791	          7891

INPFC BY DEPTH	792         	7892

INPFC BY DEPTH	793	          7893

INPFC BY DEPTH	794	          7894

- The SURVEY field was removed from GAP_PRODUCTS.SURVEY_DESIGN

- The 2023 versions of the Bering Slope areas were used to calculate indices and comps. As a result, the GAP_PRODUCTS.SURVEY_DESIGN table was modified to include DESIGN_YEAR = 2023 for all Bering Sea slope survey years. As a result, the Bering Sea slope biomass values for all SPECIES_CODE values will be slightly modified.  

- The EBS Standard Area agecomps are now added to the GAP_PRODUCTS.AGECOMP table. To distinguish these agecomps from those from the EBS Standard + NW area, an additional field called AREA_ID_FOOTPRINT has been created to distinguish the two EBS survey footprints. Unique values for this field will be 'GOA', 'AI', 'BSS', 'EBS STANDARD', 'EBS STANDARD PLUS NW', 'NBS'.
