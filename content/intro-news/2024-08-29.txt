GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2024-08-29) using gapindex v2.2.0
The additions of previous yearsâ€™ age data and 2024 EBS catch, effort, and size data
documented in the August 20th gap_products run were partially
completed in that run. The N_HAUL and N_LENGTH fields in the biomass table
additions and the AREA_SWEPT_KM2 field in the cpue table additions were NULL. This
was found to be an issue in how the mismatches.RDS R object was created in the
check_tables.R script and has been corrected in commit (1f9d651d7edd7ad8789ffa645acd52333807ac54).
To rectify this in the GAP_PRODUCTS oracle tables, these commands were executed
on 8/28/2024 to revert those additions:

DELETE
FROM GAP_PRODUCTS.BIOMASS WHERE N_HAUL IS NULL AND N_LENGTH IS NULL;
DELETE
FROM GAP_PRODUCTS.CPUE WHERE AREA_SWEPT_KM2 IS NULL;
commit;

Records
GAP_PRODUCTS.TAXONOMIC_GROUPS of SPECIES_CODE values (82691, 82741, 82740,
82690) were found to be duplicated, leading to a doubling of estimated catch
rates for these SPECIES_CODE values. This issue has been resolved (see commit 93b1e3360e6aae1d3c8a0c407aa8ccf807cd78db)
and documented in this github issue (https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/issues/47). 

Other changes to the age composition data are from updated read otoliths data for EBS
Kamchatka flounder (2015, 2022), EBS Greenland turbot (2023), GOA northern rock
sole (2023) and GOA northern rockfish (2023).
