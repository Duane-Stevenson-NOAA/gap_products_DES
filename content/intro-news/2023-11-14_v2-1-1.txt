GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2023-11-14) using gapindex v2.1.1
A new version of gapindex (v2.1.1) was used to produced these data. There was a slight change to how subarea biomass totals are calculated. The modified biomass records reflect this change. New 2022 otolith data were available since the last iteration of the GAP_PRODUCTS for Aleutian Island Pacific ocean perch and northern rockifsh and Eastern Bering Sea northern rock sole. Zero-filled CPUE records for four GOA species codes (SPECIES_CODE: 21210, 30010, 30360, 77102, 98101) were added due to how the 1990 data were integrated in the last production run of GAP_PRODUCTS. Two Arctic cod (SPECIES_CODE: 21725) and one plain sculpin (SPECIES_CODE: 21371) count records were modified in the NBS data, which changes the numerical CPUE estimates for those hauls which changes the estimated population abundance and size composition for those species.
