GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2024-10-22) using gapindex v2.2.0
Run completed by: Zack Oyafuso

A development branch version of gapindex called [using_datatable](https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/tree/using_datatable) uses the data.table package for many dataframe manipulations, which greatly decreased the computation time of many of the functions. There were no major changes in the calculations in this version of the gapindex package and thus the major changes listed below are not related to the gapindex package.

Modified records were not updated due to a bug in the code during th 10/21/2024 run have now been recitfied.

Two Bering skate (435) lengths were converted to unid. skate (400).
