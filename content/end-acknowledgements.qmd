# Community Acknowledgments

We would like to thank the many communities of Alaska and their members who have helped contribute to this body of work. The knowledge, experiences, and insights have been instrumental in expanding the scope of our science and knowledge to encompass the many issues that face this important ecosystem. We appreciate feedback from those residing in the region that are willing to share their insights and participation in an open dialog about how we can improve our collective knowledge of the ecosystem and the region.
