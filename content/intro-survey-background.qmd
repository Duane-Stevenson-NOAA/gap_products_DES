## What is the research objective?

The objectives of these surveys are to:

- monitor trends in the marine ecosystem of the Bering Sea, Aleutian Islands, and Gulf of Alaska
- produce fishery-independent biomass and abundance estimates for commercially important fish and crab species
- collect biological and environmental data for use in ecosystem-based fishery management.

Learn more about the [program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/science-data/groundfish-assessment-program-bottom-trawl-surveys)

## Who is conducting the research?

Scientists from the Alaska Fisheries Science Center conduct these bottom trawl surveys with participation from the Alaska Department of Fish & Game (ADF&G), the International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC), and universities. This research is conducted on chartered fishing vessels.

Each survey conducted by the [Groundfish Assessment Program](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/population-assessments/north-pacific-groundfish-stock-assessments-and-fishery-evaluation) are multispecies bottom trawl surveys. We collect environmental and biological data to assess how climate variability and [loss of sea](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/ecosystems/habitat-and-ecological-processes-research-regarding-loss-sea-ice) ice are affecting bottom-dwelling marine life on the Bering Sea shelf. We monitor trends in the distribution (location and movement patterns) and abundance of groundfish and crab species as well as oceanographic data (e.g., water temperature, depth). We collect biological information such as organism weight, length, stomachs to learn about diets, and [otoliths](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/science-data/alaska-age-and-growth-procedures-otolith-examination) to [determine fish ages](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/science-data/fish-otolith-chronologies). We use this information in [annual stock assessments](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/alaska/population-assessments/north-pacific-groundfish-stock-assessments-and-fishery-evaluation) and to assess the state of the ecosystem. This research is conducted on fishing industry contract vessels.
