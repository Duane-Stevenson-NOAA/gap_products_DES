## Early 2023

The main goal here to simplify the data management or to also standardize the way stock assessors are using RACE data. 

We have decided to undergo this organizational change to meet the following best practices and long-term data goals. Let us know how we can better meet these objectives and best work with IT: 

 - Minimize duplication (both in tables and in columns within tables)
 - Minimize schemata and Oracle objects to the extent possible
 - Streamlined integration of tables
 - Minimize work for data creators
 - Minimize confusion and obstacles for data users
 - Security and data management best practices

After the 2023 field season, we will deprecate the old AKFIN tables and completely replace the current tables with new tables, outlined in this document.
