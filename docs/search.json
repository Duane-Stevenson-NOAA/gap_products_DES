    "text": "Objective\nPlease refer to our Draft Data Changes Brief. Once finalized, this language will be included here.\nGAP produces numerous data products* that are subjected to different levels of processing, ranging from raw to highly-derived. The suitability of these data products for analysis varies and there is ambiguity about which data products can be used for which purpose. This ambiguity can create challenges in communicating about data products and potentially lead to misunderstanding and misuse of data. One approach to communicating about the level of processing applied to data products and their suitability for analysis is to describe data products using a Data Processing Level system. Data Processing Level systems are widely used in earth system sciences to characterize the extent of processing that has been applied to data products. For example, the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Satellite Program uses a Data Processing Level system to describe data on a scale of 0-4, where Level 0 is raw data and Level 4 is model output or results from analysis. Example of how NASA remote sensing data products are shared through a public data portal with levels of data processing and documentation.\nFor more information, see Sean Rohan’s October 2022 SCRUGS presentation on the topic.\nUse the below bibtext citations, as cited in our group’s citation repository for citing the data created and maintained in this repo.

Quality codes follow: **'High'**: High confidence and consistency. Taxonomy is stable and reliable at this level, and field identification characteristics are well known and reliable. **'Moderate'**: Moderate confidence. Taxonomy may be questionable at this level, or field identification characteristics may be variable and difficult to assess consistently. **'Low'**: Low confidence. Taxonomy is incompletely known, or reliable field identification characteristics are unknown.

The vessel also receives it's MMSI number, so that each vessel is uniquely identified.VESSEL_COAST_GUARD_NUMBERVessel Coast Guard NumberID codeNUMBER(38,0)Official Identification number as defined by www.dco.uscg.mil. The Official Number (O/N) is the 6 or 7 digit number awarded to the vessel at the time it is first documented with the US Coast Guard. This number remains with the vessel indefinitely and should be marked in accordance with 46 CFR 67.121.VESSEL_IDVessel IDID codeNUMBER(38,0)ID number of the vessel used to collect data for that haul. The column 'vessel_id' is associated with the 'vessel_name' column. Note that it is possible for a vessel to have a new name but the same vessel id number. For a complete list of vessel ID codes, review the [code books](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/groundfish-survey-species-code-manual-and-data-codes-manual).VESSEL_IMOVessel International Maritime Organization NumberID codeNUMBER(38,0)The International Maritime Organization (IMO) number consists of the letters \"IMO\" followed by a unique, seven-digit number: the pattern is \"NNNNNNN\", where N is a single-digit number, e.g., \"1234567\"VESSEL_LENGTH_MVessel LengthmetersNUMBER(38,0)The length of vessel in meters.VESSEL_MMSIVessel Maritime Mobile Service IdentitiesID codeNUMBER(38,0)Maritime Mobile Service Identities (MMSIs) are nine-digit numbers used by maritime digital selective calling (DSC), automatic identification systems (AIS) and certain other equipment to uniquely identify a ship or a coast radio station.VESSEL_NAMEVessel NametextVARCHAR2(255 BYTE)Name of the vessel used to collect data for that haul. The column 'vessel_name' is associated with the 'vessel_id' column. Note that it is possible for a vessel to have a new name but the same vessel id number.

    "text": "10.1 Data description\nThe Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts fisheries-independent bottom trawl surveys to monitor the condition of the demersal fish and crab stocks of Alaska. These data are developed to describe the temporal distribution and abundance of commercially and ecologically important groundfish species, examine the changes in the species composition of the fauna over time and space, and describe the physical environment of the groundfish habitat.\nThere are no legal restrictions on access to the data. They reside in the public domain and can be freely distributed. Users must read and fully comprehend the metadata prior to use. Data should not be used beyond the limits of the source scale. Acknowledgement of NOAA, as the source from which these data were obtained, in any publications and/or other representations of these data, is suggested. These data are compiled and approved annually after each summer survey season. The data from previous years are unlikely to change substantially once published.\nThese data are zero-filled (presence and absence) observations from surveys conducted on fishing vessels. These surveys monitor trends in distribution and abundance of groundfish, crab, and bottom-dwelling species in Alaska’s marine ecosystems. These data include estimates of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) for all identified species for index stations. Some survey data are excluded, such as non-standard stations, surveys completed in earlier years using different/non-standard gear, and special tows and non-standard data collections.\nThough not included in the public data, these surveys also collect oceanographic and environmental data, and biological data such as length, weight, stomach contents (to learn more about diet), otoliths (fish ear bones to learn about age), and tissue samples for genetic analysis, all of which can be shared upon special request. Also not included in the public data are estimated biomass (average total weight of all fish and crabs sampled) of crabs and groundfish that support the creation of annual stock assessments."

To begin a report, select options from the boxes what you need data for.\nFor a given box, select one or a few options from the “options box” (list on the left) to query by highlighting them. To select multiple options, hold down the CTRL key while clicking on the options of interest, or click and drag down the list. Once the options you wish to be included in your query are highlighted, click the right-pointing arrow (&gt;) to move them into the “selection box” (list on the right). If you accidentally select an option that you do not want to query, simply select the unwanted option from the selection box and click the left-pointing arrow (&lt;).\nIf you wish to select all options from the options box and send them to the selection box, simply click the double right-pointing arrow (&gt;&gt;). If you want to unselect all options from the selection box, use the double left-pointing arrow (&lt;&lt;) or the reset icon.\nTo find a specific species or group more quickly you can use the Search Species option to quickly narrow the options. Search for parts of species common names in the Search Species box by entering a term and clicking the search button. The platform will return a shorter list in the Speices options box of only species that contain a match to that search term.\nUse the Reset All Parameters button to reset all parameters for entire form.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of selection and search tools available on the FOSS platofrom.\n\n\n\n\nFilter options:\n\nSurvey: Each survey has different in design, time series, and history.

Find more information about these species in our survey code books.\n\n\nIn this example, we’ll select for 2022 eastern Bering Sea Pacific cod data.

    "text": "12.0.1 {afscgap} Library Installation\n\nauthor: Sam Pottinger (sam.pottinger@berkeley.edu; GitHub::sampottinger) date: May 13, 2023\n\nThe third-party afscgap Python package interfaces with FOSS to access AFSC GAP data. It can be installed via pip:\n\n#The reticulate package provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. \nlibrary(reticulate)\n\n\npip install afscgap\npip install git+https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/afscgap.git@main\n\nFor more information on installation and deployment, see the library documentation.\n\n\n12.0.2 Basic query\nThis first example queries for Pacific glass shrimp (Pasiphaea pacifica) in the Gulf of Alaska in 2021. The library will automatically generate HTTP queries, converting from Python types to ORDS query syntax.\n\nimport afscgap\n\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(eq=2021)\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\n\nresults = query.execute()\n\nThe results variable in this example is an iterator that will automatically perform pagination behind the scenes.\n\n\n12.0.3 Iterating with a for loop\nThe easiest way to interact with results is a simple for loop. This next example determines the frequency of different catch per unit effort where Pacific glass shrimp were reported:\n\nimport afscgap\n\n# Mapping from CPUE to count\ncount_by_cpue = {}\n\n# Build query\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(eq=2021)\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\nresults = query.execute()\n\n# Iterate through results and count\nfor record in results:\n  cpue = record.get_cpue_weight(units='kg/ha')\n  cpue_rounded = round(cpue)\n  count = count_by_cpue.get(cpue_rounded, 0) + 1\n  count_by_cpue[cpue_rounded] = count\n\n# Print the result\nprint(count_by_cpue)\n\nNote that, in this example, only records with Pacific glass shrimp are included (“presence-only” data). See zero catch inference below. In other words, it reports on CPUE only for hauls in which Pacific glass shrimp were recorded, excluding some hauls like those in which Pacific glass shrimp were not found at all.\n\n\n12.0.4 Iterating with functional programming\nA for loop is not the only option for iterating through results. List comprehensions and other functional programming methods can be used as well.\n\nimport statistics\n\nimport afscgap\n\n# Build query\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(eq=2021)\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\nresults = query.execute()\n\n# Get temperatures in Celsius\ntemperatures = [record.get_bottom_temperature(units='c') for record in results]\n\n# Take the median\nprint(statistics.median(temperatures))\n\nThis example reports the median temperature in Celcius for when Pacific glass shrimp was reported.\n\n\n12.0.5 Load into Pandas\nThe results from the afscgap package are serializable and can be loaded into other tools like Pandas. This example loads Pacific glass shrimp from 2021 Gulf of Alaska into a data frame.\n\nimport pandas\n\nimport afscgap\n\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(eq=2021)\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\nresults = query.execute()\n\npandas.DataFrame(results.to_dicts())\n\nSpecifically, to_dicts provides an iterator over a dictionary form of the data that can be read into tools like Pandas.\n\n\n12.0.6 Advanced filtering\nQueries so far have focused on filters requiring equality but range queries can be built as well.\n\nimport afscgap\n\n# Build query\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(min_val=2015, max_val=2019)   # Note min/max_val\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\nresults = query.execute()\n\n# Sum weight\nweights = map(lambda x: x.get_weight(units='kg'), results)\ntotal_weight = sum(weights)\nprint(total_weight)\n\nThis example queries for Pacific glass shrimp data between 2015 and 2019, summing the total weight caught. Note that most users will likely take advantage of built-in Python to ORDS query generation which dictates how the library communicates with the API service. However, users can provide raw ORDS queries as well using manual filtering.\n\n\n12.0.7 Zero-catch inference\nUntil this point, these examples use presence-only data. However, the afscgap package can infer negative or “zero catch” records as well.\n\nimport afscgap\n\n# Mapping from CPUE to count\ncount_by_cpue = {}\n\n# Build query\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(eq=2021)\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\nquery.set_presence_only(False)  # Added to earlier example\nresults = query.execute()\n\n# Iterate through results and count\nfor record in results:\n  cpue = record.get_cpue_weight(units='kg/ha')\n  cpue_rounded = round(cpue)\n  count = count_by_cpue.get(cpue_rounded, 0) + 1\n  count_by_cpue[cpue_rounded] = count\n\n# Print the result\nprint(count_by_cpue)\n\nThis example revisits the earlier snippet for CPUE counts but set_presence_only(False) directs the library to look at additional data on hauls, determining which hauls did not have Pacific glass shrimp. This lets the library return records for hauls in which Pacific glass shrimp were not found. This can be seen in differences in counts reported:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRounded CPUE\nCount with set_presence_only(True)\nCount with set_presence_only(False)\n\n\n\n\n0 kg/ha\n44\n521\n\n\n1 kg/ha\n7\n7\n\n\n2 kg/ha\n1\n1\n\n\n\nPut simply, while the earlier example showed CPUE counts for hauls in which Pacific glass shrimp were seen, this revised example reports for all hauls in the Gulf of Alaska in 2021.\n\n\n12.0.8 More information\nPlease see the API documentation for the Python library for additional details."
