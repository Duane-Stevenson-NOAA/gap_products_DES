Each survey is a multispecies survey that collects data on the distribution, abundance, and biological characteristics of fish, crab, and other resources to inform groundfish stock assessment and management. These fishery-independent surveys are conducted in the summer aboard contracted commercial fishing vessels. Specifics regarding each of the surveys can be found below.",

These data products only use data from standard and validated hauls, and has undergone careful review.\nOnce survey data collected on the vessel has been checked and validated, the gap_products/code/run.R script is used to orchestrate a sequence of programs that calculate the standard data products resulting from the NOAA AFSC GAP bottom trawl surveys. Standard data products are the CPUE, BIOMASS, SIZECOMP, and AGECOMP tables in the GAP_PRODUCTS Oracle schema. The tables are slated to be updated twice a year: once after the survey season following finalization of that summer’s bottom trawl survey data to incorporate the new catch, size, and effort data and once prior to an upcoming survey to incorporate new age data that were processed after the prior summer’s survey season ended. This second pre-survey production run will also incorporate changes in the data due to the specimen voucher process as well as other post-hoc changes in the survey data.\n\nThe data from these surveys constitute a living data set so we can continue to provide the best available data to all partners, stakeholders, and fellow scientists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A([Catch data\\ndeck tablet]) --&gt; B1[METIS Biological\\ndata editing\\nsoftware]\n  A1([Length data\\ndeck tablets]) --&gt; B1\n  A2([Specimen data\\ndeck tablet]) --&gt; B1\n  A3([Haul performance w/ Marport sensors]) --&gt; B2[Wheelhouse &\\nCalyposo \\nhaul data] \n  A4([CTD]) --&gt; B2\n  A5([sea state\\nobersvations]) --&gt; B2\n  A6([HOBO bottom\\ncontact sensor]) --&gt; B2\n  A7{{navmaps\\nR package\\nfor navigation}} --&gt; B2\n  B1 --&gt; C[GIDES &\\nRACE_EDIT\\nOracle schema\\n& whole-survey\\nreview &\\ndata checking]\n  B2 --&gt; C\n  C --&gt; D[RACEBASE\\nand RACE_DATA\\nOracle schemata]\n  D1{{gapindex R package}} --&gt; F[Public Data Product:\\ntables in\\nGAP_PRODUCTS\\nOracle schema]\n  D2{{gap_products\\nR scripts}} --&gt; F\n  D --&gt; D1\n  D1 --&gt; D2\n  D --&gt; F\n  subgraph AA[Data Level 0: Raw]\n  A\n  A1\n  A2\n  A3\n  A4\n  A5\n  A6\n  A7\n  end\n  subgraph BB[Data Level 1:\\nQA/QC'ed data]\n  B1\n  B2\n  end\n  subgraph CC[Data Level 2:\\nAnalysis ready product for internal use]\n  C\n  D\n  end\n  subgraph FF[Data Level 3:\\nAnalysis ready product\\nfor external/public use]\n  F\n  end\n  style AA fill:beige,::\n  style BB fill:white,::\n  style CC fill:beige,::\n  style FF fill:white,::\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Simplified data workflow from boat to production.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring each data product run cycle:\n\nVersions of the tables in GAP_PRODUCTS are locally imported within the gap_products repository to compare with the updated production tables.

    "text": "Data levels\nGAP produces numerous data products that are subjected to different levels of processing, ranging from raw to highly-derived. The suitability of these data products for analysis varies and there is ambiguity about which data products can be used for which purpose. This ambiguity can create challenges in communicating about data products and potentially lead to misunderstanding and misuse of data. One approach to communicating about the level of processing applied to data products and their suitability for analysis is to describe data products using a Data Processing Level system. Data Processing Level systems are widely used in earth system sciences to characterize the extent of processing that has been applied to data products. For example, the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Satellite Program uses a Data Processing Level system to describe data on a scale of 0-4, where Level 0 is raw data and Level 4 is model output or results from analysis. Example of how NASA remote sensing data products are shared through a public data portal with levels of data processing and documentation.\nFor more information, see Sean Rohan’s October 2022 SCRUGS presentation on the topic.\n\nLevel 0: Raw and unprocessed data. Ex: Data on the G drive, some tables in RACE_DATA\nLevel 1: Data products with QA/QC applied that may or may not be expanded to analysis units, but either not georeferenced or does not include full metadata. Ex: Some tables in RACE_DATA and RACEBASE\nLevel 2: Analysis-ready data products that are derived for a standardized extent and account for zeros and missing/bad data.

While trying to update the records in the GAP_PRODUCTS table, the connection was terminated, partially uploading records in the agecomp tables and outputting NA to the N_HAUL and N_LENGTH fields in the biomass tables. At this point, the GAP_PRODUCTS tables are incomplete. The AKFIN and FOSS tables were NOT updated in this run.\n– GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2024-05-04) using gapindex v2.2.0: A development branch version of gapindex called using_datatable uses the data.table package for many dataframe manipulations, which greatly decreased the computation time of many of the functions. There were no major changes in the calculations in this version of the gapindex package and thus the major changes listed below are not related to the gapindex package. The only major change from this run was the addition of GOA 2023 Pacific Ocean perch read otolith data.\n– GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2024-04-09) using gapindex v2.2.0: A development branch version of gapindex called using_datatable uses the data.table package for many dataframe manipulations, which greatly decreased the computation time of many of the functions. There were no major changes in the calculations in this version of the gapindex package and thus the major changes listed below are not related to the gapindex package.\n– GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2024-02-29) using gapindex v2.2.0: A new version of gapindex 2.2.0 was used for this production run and now accesses taxonomic information from RACEBASE.SPECIES instead of GAP_PRODUCTS.TAXONOMIC_CLASSIFICATION. As a result, there will be some SPECIES_CODE values that are supported due to slight differences between the two tables. Discussion in this github issue #54. As a result there are new cpue records for SPECIES_CODE values 22290 and 22292 and removed cpue records for SPECIES_CODE values 21345, 22200 and 69326.\n– GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2024-01-09) using gapindex v2.1.3: A new version of gapindex (v2.1.3) was used to produced these data. Data for SPECIES_CODE 68590 (Chionoecetes hybrids) are now removed, per this issue (https://github.com/afsc-gap-products/gap_products/issues/3). New read otolith data were incorporated into the age compositions. GOA depth subareas are now included in the size comps, and there were some modifications with EBS skate length data that are now incorporated into the length compositions.\n– GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2023-11-17) using gapindex v2.1.2: A new version of gapindex (v2.1.2) was used to produced these data. There was a slight change to how subarea biomass totals are calculated that was not fully addressed in v2.1.1. The modified biomass records reflect this change.\n– GAP_PRODUCTS ChangeLog (last produced on 2023-11-14) using gapindex v2.1.1: A new version of gapindex (v2.1.1) was used to produced these data. There was a slight change to how subarea biomass totals are calculated. The modified biomass records reflect this change. New 2022 otolith data were available since the last iteration of the GAP_PRODUCTS for Aleutian Island Pacific ocean perch and northern rockifsh and Eastern Bering Sea northern rock sole. Zero-filled CPUE records for four GOA species codes (SPECIES_CODE: 21210, 30010, 30360, 77102, 98101) were added due to how the 1990 data were integrated in the last production run of GAP_PRODUCTS. Two Arctic cod (SPECIES_CODE: 21725) and one plain sculpin (SPECIES_CODE: 21371) count records were modified in the NBS data, which changes the numerical CPUE estimates for those hauls which changes the estimated population abundance and size composition for those species.\n– Groundfish Assessment Program Survey Data Serving and Data Improvements: Initial data changes brief distributed to SSMA and other partners by Ned Laman, Zack Oyafuso, and Emily Markowitz\n– Run 2023-06-01 gapindex v2.1.0: Initial compiling and planning notes",

Find more information about these species in our survey code books.\n\nFor a given box, select one or a few options from the options box (list on the left) to query. To select multiple options, hold down the CTRL key while clicking on the options of interest, or click and drag down the list. Once the options you wish to be included in your query are highlighted, click the right-pointing arrow (&gt;) to move them into the “selection box” (list on the right). This can also be achieved by double clicking the option item of interest. If you accidentally select an option that you do not want to query, simply select the unwanted option from the selection box and click the left-pointing arrow (&lt;).\nIf you wish to select all options from the options box and send them to the selection box, simply click the double right-pointing arrow (&gt;&gt;). If you want to unselect all options from the selection box, use the double left-pointing arrow (&lt;&lt;) or the reset icon.\nTo find a specific species or group more quickly you can use the Search Species option to quickly narrow the options. Search for parts of species common names in the Search Species box by entering a term and clicking the search button. The platform will return a shorter list in the Speices options box of only species that contain a match to that search term.\nUse the Reset All Parameters button to reset all parameters for entire form.\n\n\n\n\n\nDiagram of selection and search tools available on the FOSS platfrom.",

To find out which species_code to use, you can check variations on the following code. Note that here the word pollock is case sensitive. All species common_name entries are lower case except for proper nouns (e.g., “Pacific”). The notation for finding a string is to use % around the phrase. Since % is a reserved character in a URL, you have to replace % with %25. Similarly, %20 needs to be used in place of a space (e.g., between “walleye” and “pollock”: \"walleye%20pollock\"}').\n\n## query the API link. Use: \nres &lt;- httr::GET(url = paste0(api_link_species, '?q={%22common_name%22:%22walleye%20pollock%22}'))\n# OR\nres &lt;- httr::GET(url = paste0(api_link_species,

    "text": "{afscgap} Library Installation\n\nauthor: Sam Pottinger (sam.pottinger@berkeley.edu; GitHub::sampottinger) date: May 13, 2023\n\nThe third-party afscgap Python package interfaces with FOSS to access AFSC GAP data. It can be installed via pip:\n\n#The reticulate package provides a comprehensive set of tools for interoperability between Python and R. \nlibrary(reticulate)\n\n\npip install afscgap\npip install git+https://github.com/SchmidtDSE/afscgap.git@main\n\nFor more information on installation and deployment, see the library documentation.\n\n\nBasic query\nThis first example queries for Pacific glass shrimp (Pasiphaea pacifica) in the Gulf of Alaska in 2021. The library will automatically generate HTTP queries, converting from Python types to ORDS query syntax.\n\nimport afscgap\n\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(eq=2021)\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\n\nresults = query.execute()\n\nThe results variable in this example is an iterator that will automatically perform pagination behind the scenes.\n\n\nIterating with a for loop\nThe easiest way to interact with results is a simple for loop. This next example determines the frequency of different catch per unit effort where Pacific glass shrimp were reported:\n\nimport afscgap\n\n# Mapping from CPUE to count\ncount_by_cpue = {}\n\n# Build query\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(eq=2021)\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\nresults = query.execute()\n\n# Iterate through results and count\nfor record in results:\n  cpue = record.get_cpue_weight(units='kg/ha')\n  cpue_rounded = round(cpue)\n  count = count_by_cpue.get(cpue_rounded, 0) + 1\n  count_by_cpue[cpue_rounded] = count\n\n# Print the result\nprint(count_by_cpue)\n\nNote that, in this example, only records with Pacific glass shrimp are included (“presence-only” data). See zero catch inference below. In other words, it reports on CPUE only for hauls in which Pacific glass shrimp were recorded, excluding some hauls like those in which Pacific glass shrimp were not found at all.\n\n\nIterating with functional programming\nA for loop is not the only option for iterating through results. List comprehensions and other functional programming methods can be used as well.\n\nimport statistics\n\nimport afscgap\n\n# Build query\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(eq=2021)\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\nresults = query.execute()\n\n# Get temperatures in Celsius\ntemperatures = [record.get_bottom_temperature(units='c') for record in results]\n\n# Take the median\nprint(statistics.median(temperatures))\n\nThis example reports the median temperature in Celcius for when Pacific glass shrimp was reported.\n\n\nLoad into Pandas\nThe results from the afscgap package are serializable and can be loaded into other tools like Pandas. This example loads Pacific glass shrimp from 2021 Gulf of Alaska into a data frame.\n\nimport pandas\n\nimport afscgap\n\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(eq=2021)\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\nresults = query.execute()\n\npandas.DataFrame(results.to_dicts())\n\nSpecifically, to_dicts provides an iterator over a dictionary form of the data that can be read into tools like Pandas.\n\n\nAdvanced filtering\nQueries so far have focused on filters requiring equality but range queries can be built as well.\n\nimport afscgap\n\n# Build query\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(min_val=2015, max_val=2019)   # Note min/max_val\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\nresults = query.execute()\n\n# Sum weight\nweights = map(lambda x: x.get_weight(units='kg'), results)\ntotal_weight = sum(weights)\nprint(total_weight)\n\nThis example queries for Pacific glass shrimp data between 2015 and 2019, summing the total weight caught. Note that most users will likely take advantage of built-in Python to ORDS query generation which dictates how the library communicates with the API service. However, users can provide raw ORDS queries as well using manual filtering.\n\n\nZero-catch inference\nUntil this point, these examples use presence-only data. However, the afscgap package can infer negative or “zero catch” records as well.\n\nimport afscgap\n\n# Mapping from CPUE to count\ncount_by_cpue = {}\n\n# Build query\nquery = afscgap.Query()\nquery.filter_year(eq=2021)\nquery.filter_srvy(eq='GOA')\nquery.filter_scientific_name(eq='Pasiphaea pacifica')\nquery.set_presence_only(False)  # Added to earlier example\nresults = query.execute()\n\n# Iterate through results and count\nfor record in results:\n  cpue = record.get_cpue_weight(units='kg/ha')\n  cpue_rounded = round(cpue)\n  count = count_by_cpue.get(cpue_rounded, 0) + 1\n  count_by_cpue[cpue_rounded] = count\n\n# Print the result\nprint(count_by_cpue)\n\nThis example revisits the earlier snippet for CPUE counts but set_presence_only(False) directs the library to look at additional data on hauls, determining which hauls did not have Pacific glass shrimp. This lets the library return records for hauls in which Pacific glass shrimp were not found. This can be seen in differences in counts reported:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRounded CPUE\nCount with set_presence_only(True)\nCount with set_presence_only(False)\n\n\n\n\n0 kg/ha\n44\n521\n\n\n1 kg/ha\n7\n7\n\n\n2 kg/ha\n1\n1\n\n\n\nPut simply, while the earlier example showed CPUE counts for hauls in which Pacific glass shrimp were seen, this revised example reports for all hauls in the Gulf of Alaska in 2021.\n\n\nMore information\nPlease see the API documentation for the Python library for additional details.",
