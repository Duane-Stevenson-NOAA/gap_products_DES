    "text": "Background of the gap_products repo\nThis work is the result of the massive efforts of three concurrent GAP working groups:\n\nIndex Computation Working Group: consolidation of the methods used to produced design-based estimates of abundance and size/age composition between the Bering Sea and AIGOA survey regions.\nData Processes Working Group: reorganization of the Oracle data infrastructure that houses the standard data products produced by GAP.\nGulf of Alaska Survey Restratification Working Group: implementation of a new stratified random survey design in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey.\n\nWe began this effort in collaboration with the Status of Stocks team (SSMA) to present both the orientation and opportunity to interact with Gulf of Alaska data from the restratified survey design that we will be implementing in the 2025 field season. As that part of the project evolved, the Data Processes Working Group identified the opportunity and need for gaining efficiencies by redesigning and consolidating the Oracle objects (tables and materialized views) that have historically served these data. The Index Computation Working Group also identified an opportunity to gain efficiencies by consolidating the various scripts that were developed independently by both survey region groups into a workflow that was more accessible and documented.\nThe Index Computation Working Group developed the gapindex R package, a code repository that consolidates the code that calculates the various standard GAP products (e.g., CPUE, total biomass, size/age composition) for both the Bering Sea and AIGOA survey regions. The Data Processes Working Group was responsible for compiling the data structures needed to support data product tables that were consistent across all of the AFSC GAP survey regions as well as the creation of the GAP_PRODUCTS oracle schema that will house these consolidated products in the future.\nThis gap_products GitHub repository houses the code that will conduct the “standard production run” that produces the new data tables via the gapindex R package and upload those tables to the GAP_PRODUCTS Oracle schema."

We collect environmental and biological data to assess how climate variability and loss of sea ice are affecting bottom-dwelling marine life on the Bering Sea shelf. We monitor trends in the distribution (location and movement patterns) and abundance of groundfish and crab species as well as oceanographic data (e.g., water temperature, depth). We collect biological information such as organism weight, length, stomachs to learn about diets, and otoliths to determine fish ages.

    "section": "2.1 Data levels",
    "text": "2.1 Data levels\nGAP produces numerous data products* that are subjected to different levels of processing, ranging from raw to highly-derived. The suitability of these data products for analysis varies and there is ambiguity about which data products can be used for which purpose. This ambiguity can create challenges in communicating about data products and potentially lead to misunderstanding and misuse of data. One approach to communicating about the level of processing applied to data products and their suitability for analysis is to describe data products using a Data Processing Level system. Data Processing Level systems are widely used in earth system sciences to characterize the extent of processing that has been applied to data products. For example, the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) Satellite Program uses a Data Processing Level system to describe data on a scale of 0-4, where Level 0 is raw data and Level 4 is model output or results from analysis. Example of how NASA remote sensing data products are shared through a public data portal with levels of data processing and documentation.\nFor more information, see Sean Rohan’s October 2022 SCRUGS presentation on the topic.\n\nLevel 0: Raw and unprocessed data. Ex: Data on the G drive, some tables in RACE_DATA\nLevel 1A: Data products with QA/QC applied that may or may not be expanded to analysis units, but either not georeferenced or does not include full metadata. Ex: Some tables in RACE_DATA and RACEBASE\nLevel 2: Analysis-ready data products that are derived for a standardized extent and account for zeros and missing/bad data. Ex: CPUE tables, some data products in public-facing archives and repositories\nLevel 3: Data products that are synthesized across a standardized extent, often inputs in a higher-level analytical product. Ex: Abundance indices, some data products in public-facing archives and repositories\nLevel 4: Analytically generated data products that are derived from lower-level data, often to inform management. Ex: Biological reference points from stock assessments, Essential Fish Habitat layers, indicators in Ecosystem Status Reports and Ecosystem and Socioeconomic Profiles"

These data are compiled and approved annually after each summer survey season. The data from previous years are unlikely to change substantially once published.
