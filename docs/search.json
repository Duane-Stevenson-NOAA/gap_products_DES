    "section": "Background of the gap_products repo",
    "text": "Background of the gap_products repo\nThis work is the result of the massive efforts of three concurrent GAP working groups:\n\nIndex Computation Working Group: consolidation of the methods used to produced design-based estimates of abundance and size/age composition between the Bering Sea and AIGOA survey regions.\nData Processes Working Group: reorganization of the Oracle data infrastructure that houses the standard data products produced by GAP.\nGulf of Alaska Survey Restratification Working Group: implementation of a new stratified random survey design in the Gulf of Alaska bottom trawl survey.\n\nWe began this effort in collaboration with the Status of Stocks team (SSMA) to present both the orientation and opportunity to interact with Gulf of Alaska data from the restratified survey design that we will be implementing in the 2025 field season. As that part of the project evolved, the Data Processes Working Group identified the opportunity and need for gaining efficiencies by redesigning and consolidating the Oracle objects (tables and materialized views) that have historically served these data. The Index Computation Working Group also identified an opportunity to gain efficiencies by consolidating the various scripts that were developed independently by both survey region groups into a workflow that was more accessible and documented.\nThe Index Computation Working Group developed the gapindex R package, a code repository that consolidates the code that calculates the various standard GAP products (e.g., CPUE, total biomass, size/age composition) for both the Bering Sea and AIGOA survey regions. The Data Processes Working Group was responsible for compiling the data structures needed to support data product tables that were consistent across all of the AFSC GAP survey regions as well as the creation of the GAP_PRODUCTS oracle schema that will house these consolidated products in the future.\nThis gap_products GitHub repository houses the code that will conduct the “standard production run” that produces the new data tables via the gapindex R package and upload those tables to the GAP_PRODUCTS Oracle schema."

    "section": "Major Advantages",
    "text": "Major Advantages\n\nConsolidated production tables include all standard data products for all surveys. Data will be provided in the same format, with the same units, and created using the same mathematical methodology. This should limit data pulls, reduce complexity for data access, and reduce complicated secondary data wrangling.\nConsistent naming conventions for schemata, tables, and column metadata. Columns across all tables will use the same naming conventions, units, and data types. Restricting standard data product table content to absolutely necessary columns.\nRemoval of redundant data columns that can be acquired by joining to reference tables is key for providing consistent and up-to-date data while limiting data table sizes.\nConsolidation and repurposing of Oracle schemata. This will help the GAP team limit unnecessary access to unprocessed or problematic data by outside users.\nVetted data methods. All code and data inclusion decisions and wrangling are documented in the {gapindex} R package. Streamlined and rapid data production. Improved and consolidated data creation and documentation provide data creators and users with greater confidence in the data products and enhanced ability to share the data."

    "text": "Data Description\nThe Resource Assessment and Conservation Engineering Division (RACE) Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) of the Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) conducts fisheries-independent bottom trawl surveys to monitor the condition of the demersal fish and crab stocks of Alaska. These data are developed to describe the temporal distribution and abundance of commercially and ecologically important groundfish species, examine the changes in the species composition of the fauna over time and space, and describe the physical environment of the groundfish habitat.\nUsers must read and fully comprehend the metadata prior to use. Data should not be used beyond the limits of the source scale. Acknowledgement of NOAA, as the source from which these data were obtained, in any publications and/or other representations of these data, is suggested. These data are compiled and approved annually after each summer survey season. The data from previous years are unlikely to change substantially once published. Some survey data are excluded, such as non-standard stations, surveys completed in earlier years using different/non-standard gear, and special tows and non-standard data collections."
